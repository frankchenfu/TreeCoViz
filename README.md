## ‚öôÔ∏è Build from Source (Optional)

If you prefer to build TreeCoViz on your own system (e.g., to customize features or to run on other systems), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frankchenfu/TreeCoViz.git
   cd TreeCoViz
   ```

2. **Create a Conda environment** using the provided `environment.yml`:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate treecoviz
   ```

3. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   python src/client.py
   ```

4. **(Optional) Build a standalone executable** using PyInstaller or NiceGUI:

   * NiceGUI (recommended):
     ```bash
     nicegui-pack --onefile --windowed --name TreeCoViz src/client.py
     ```
     
   * PyInstaller:
     ```bash
     pip install pyinstaller
     pyinstaller main.spec
     ```

   
   > ‚úÖ Note: The executable will be placed in the `dist/` folder as `TreeCoViz` (Linux) or `TreeCoViz.exe` (Windows).

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Q: Double-click does nothing on Linux?**

A: Run from terminal to capture error messages: `./TreeCoViz`

**Q: Error about missing Qt or GTK when running?**

A: Ensure the Qt dependencies listed above are installed, or try to reinstall Qt with pip.

**Q: Can I run this on MacOS?**

A: Not officially supported yet, but it may run using Python source and a suitable GUI backend. For more information, please refer to [NiceGUI Installation and Deployment](https://nicegui.io/documentation/section_configuration_deployment#package_for_installation) for MacOS.

**Q: Why does the program start slow?**

A: On first run, starting the graphical interface may be slow, especially while loading the Qt backend and initializing components. If it runs on Windows, binding dynamic links may takes longer. But after that, it works properly and runs fast.
